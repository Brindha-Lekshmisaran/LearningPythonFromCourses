    "### Logic:\n",
    "The approach in the given code works by only reversing half of the number, making the comparison more efficient, especially for larger numbers. It avoids the higher space complexity due to string conversions, especially for larger integers. \n",
    "It effectively handles both even and odd-length numbers. For odd-length numbers, it ignores the middle digit by comparing x and result // 10, effectively excluding it from the comparison.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Explanation of each step:\n",
    "1. **Initial Checks**: The function first verifies if the number is negative or if it's a positive number ending in zero (as a number ending in zero cannot form a palindrome). If either condition is met, the function returns False.\n",
    "   \n",
    "2. **Palindrome Check**:\n",
    "    - Initialize a variable `result` to 0.\n",
    "    - The code uses a while loop to reverse the first half of the input number.\n",
    "    - In each iteration of the loop, it takes the last digit of the number and adds it to `result` after multiplying `result` by 10 to shift its position to the left.\n",
    "    - Simultaneously, it removes the last digit from the original number by performing integer division (`x = x // 10`).\n",
    "    - The loop continues until the reversed half is equal to or exceeds the remaining digits in `x`.\n",
    "    \n",
    "3. **Return**:\n",
    "    - After the loop, the function checks for two conditions:\n",
    "        - If the original number's length was odd, it compares `x` and `result // 10` (to disregard the middle digit in an odd-length number).\n",
    "        - If the original number's length was even, it compares `x` and `result`.\n",
    "    - Returns True if either of these conditions is met, indicating a palindrome. Otherwise, returns False.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Time and Space complexities:\n",
    "- **Time Complexity**: The time complexity is O(log10(n)) where n is the input number. The code processes the input number by dividing it by 10 in each iteration until the number becomes 0, which takes logarithmic time relative to the input.\n",
    "- **Space Complexity**: The space complexity is O(1) since the algorithm uses a fixed amount of extra space regardless of the input size. It only uses a few variables (`result`, `x`) that do not grow with the input size."
